About App:

Covi-Jab can help you to find the nearest vaccination centre and slots availability. 
The appointment availability data is cached and may be up to 30 minutes old.

Covi-Jab is based on the public API's provided by the Co-WIN portal.
Here's the link to it:
https://apisetu.gov.in/public/marketplace/api/cowin/cowin-public-v2#/

Disclaimer: While Covi-Jab has real-time data, slot availability on CoWIN changes rapidly. If you see availability, please book on CoWIN instantly before the slots are lost. This will take you out of the app and open the CoWIN portal in your default browser.

For any kind of feedback and suggestions do drop me an email on gosalapps@gmail.com

For my dear IT guys specifically, testers and developers, if you have seen any issue related to the development and user-friendliness do drop me a bug on GitHub. It's an MVP where many use cases are yet to be handled so its work is in progress.
